# Skydiving-with-Doug
2D Platformer


# Game Overview:

This game is called “Skydiving with Doug”!

It’s a 2D Platformer which mixes normal platforming on land with a unique skydiving section which happens at the start of each level.
(Excluding the ‘Intro’ level, where there is no skydiving)

The game starts with a lot of regular platforming, but as you progress, the game gets harder and the skydiving section of each level becomes larger.

The Intro level is 100% normal platforming, whereas the Finale level is 100% skydiving.
